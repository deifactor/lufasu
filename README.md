A toy raytracer written in Rust based off Ray Tracing in a Weekend. Unlike the
book, it uses a library for vectors (but not collisions or raycasting) and color
math, since those are just boring and tedious to do by hand.

## What's in a name?

It's the main character of *A Wild Last Boss Appeared!*, a surprisingly good
isekai manga that I've been enjoying.
